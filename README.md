# Tide Shepherd

Guide the moon's pull to awaken the sleeping sea.

Drag the moon across the night sky to attract tidal water through ancient coastal channels. Fill the three sacred pools to awaken the sleeping sea creatures. Too fast and the water floods past; too slow and the tide retreats before the pools fill.
